# Virtual-Voice-Assistant-
This project is made using python. With this user-friendly virtual voice assistant, one can use voice commands (by virtue of speech recognition) to perform certain tasks.
Its features include clicking pictures, recording videos, getting updates of latest news, nearby restaurants and petrol station recommendations, knowing the current date and time, etc. all with the help of a voice command. 
The program uses speech recognition to listen to and recognize your voice command and then perform tasks. 
With the help of OpenCV, features like clicking pictures and recording videos are also inducted in the project.
Not only does the program use voice recognition, but the program contains a virtual voice assistant which responds to or communicates with the user.
Key modules used in the project: - opencv (cv2), speech_recognition, pyttsx3, webbrowser.
